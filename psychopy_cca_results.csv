FIR filtering BAND:,,Accuracy,"Notes: Turning speedrun = True will allow for much faster testing, but still processes the same amount of samples depending on num_seconds. I prove here the results of speedrun = True and speedrun = False are the same for num_seconds = 3, so I run fast for the rest of the trials"
